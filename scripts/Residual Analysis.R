#Residuals vs. Fitted Values:

#  Purpose: Checks for patterns indicating non-linearity or heteroscedasticity.
#Expectation: The residuals should be randomly scattered around zero.

#Residuals vs. Predictors:

##  Purpose: Examines if a specific predictor is inadequately modeled.
#Expectation: No discernible pattern in the residuals.

#Normal Q-Q Plot of Residuals:

#  Purpose: Checks the normality of residuals.
#Expectation: Residuals should align with the diagonal line for a well-fitting model.

#Scale-Location Plot (Spread-Location Plot):

#  Purpose: Tests for homoscedasticity (constant variance).
#Expectation: The spread of residuals should remain roughly constant across fitted values.

#Leverage vs. Residuals (Cook's Distance):

#Purpose: Identifies influential observations.
#Expectation: No single observation should dominate the model.
